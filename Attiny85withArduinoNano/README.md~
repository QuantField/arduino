*   Connect Arduino Nano and Attiny85 as described above, but do not connect the capacitor yet.
    Load the ‘Arduino as ISP sketch’
    Disconnect USB
    Insert capacitor
    Reconnect USB
    Load Attiny sketch of your choosing in the Arduino IDE (e.g. the ‘blink’ sketch)
    Choose ‘ATtiny85 with Arduino as ISP’ in yr ‘Tools->boards’ (see arduinoIDEchanges pic)
    Upload
    Ignore the errors about PAGEL and BS2


* ps when you run the blink example, there is no LED_BUILTIN so change as appropriate,
you can #define LED_BUILTIN 0
